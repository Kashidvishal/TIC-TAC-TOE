This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in javascripts. 
The game supports two players taking turns to mark 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid. 
The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Features: 
1. Two-player mode: Play against a friend and take turns making your moves.
2. Simple and intuitive: Easy-to-understand interface for a seamless gaming experience.
3. Winning conditions: The game automatically detects when a player has won or if it's a draw.
